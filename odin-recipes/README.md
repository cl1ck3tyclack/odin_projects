The Odin Project Foundations Course
Project: Recipes
https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes

This project is part of The Odin Project's Foundations Course.
The project is a basic recipes website.
The website consists of a main index page which links to three other recipe pages.
The website doesn't require any styling.

The assignment requires the main page to contain the usual html boilerplate, a heading and the links to the three recipes within an unordered list.

Each recipe page is required to have the name of the dish as the main heading, with an image of the finished dish below as well as an appropriately sized description heading, followed by a paragraph or two describing the recipe, the ingredients heading and unordered list, and lastly the steps heading and ordered list.

Featured recipes:
* flatbread: Tunnbröd
* porridge: Traveler's Gröt
* smoked fish: Rökt Fisk

This project should fullfil all requirements.

With this project I demonstrate the use of skills acquired in previous lessons of The Odin Project Foundations Course:
* the use of basic git, setting up a GitHub repository, atomic and conventional commit messages
* the use of basic HTML: html boilerplate, headings and paragraphs,lists, links and images.
