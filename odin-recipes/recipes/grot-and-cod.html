        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Fish was among the most common foods eaten during Viking times. This largely consisted of cod, herring, and salmon caught
           along the long Scandinavian coastline. Dried fish was likely a frequent ingredient in Viking-age cooking because it could
           be stored for long periods without spoiling. Grains could also be kept for months, and easily transported, which means 
           they were also a likely staple of a traveling Viking's diet. They were used to make bread, porridge, and beer.</p>
         <p>This dish combines stock from dried fish (cod), with shallots, barley, dill seeds and malt vinegar. As a finished meal, 
            this version of porridge looks more like a risotto than the oat porridge that adorns modern breakfast tables. Upon taste,
            it ticks all the boxes important for Viking age meals: it's surprisingly packed with flavour, filling and warm, perfect
            on a frigid day.</p>
