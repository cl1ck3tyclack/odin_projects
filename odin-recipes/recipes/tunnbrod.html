        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The Vikings crafted a diet rooted in simplicity and nutritional value. To complement their protein-rich diet, Vikings 
           turned to grains. Grains provided a reliable source of energy for their active lifestyles. They could also be kept for
           months, and were easily transported. They were used to make bread, porridge, and beer. Barely, a hardy versatile grain, 
           was a common presence, forming the basis of porridges and bread. Other grains were used, such as rye as featured in this
           recipe.</p> 
        <p>Flatbreads were among the different breads baked with grains. These small breads were made of flour, eggs and water. 
            Honey made the bread tastier. They were baked in a pan or grilled over the fire. It was not until the end of the Viking
            period that ovens were widely used in the household. Serve warm. The bread should be eaten immediately, but may be 
            frozen and then reheated. They are good with all Viking foods and just as delicious on their own. You can top them with
            whatever you’d like – cheese, cured meats, or even honey, butter or Skyr.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups of rye flour</li>
            <li>1 cup of water</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>butter for cooking (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the rye flour and salt in a large bowl. Gradually add water, mixing until you form a firm, not sticky, dough. 
                You may need slightly less or more water, depending on your flour.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into small balls about the size of a golf ball. On a well-floured surface, roll out each ball as 
                thin as possible.</li>
            <li>Heat a dry skillet over medium-high heat. You can lightly butter the skillet, but traditionally, this bread was 
                cooked without fat.</li>
            <li>Cook each flatbread for about 2-3 minutes on each side or until they are golden and have small charred spots. They 
                should puff up a bit while cooking. Serve warm. They’re delicious on their own, or you can top them with whatever 
                you’d like – cheese, cured meats, or even honey butter or Skyr.</li>
        </ol>
