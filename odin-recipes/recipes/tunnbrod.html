        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The Vikings crafted a diet rooted in simplicity and nutritional value.<br /> To complement their protein-rich diet, 
           Vikings turned to grains.<br /> Grains provided a reliable source of energy for their active lifestyles.<br /> They could 
           also be kept for months, and were easily transported.<br /> Grains were used to make bread, porridge, and beer.<br />
           Barley, a hardy versatile grain, was a common presence,<br /> forming the basis of porridges and bread. Other grains were
           used,<br /> such as rye as featured in this recipe.</p> 
        <p>Flatbreads were among the different breads baked with grains.<br /> These small breads were made of flour, eggs and water. 
           <br /> They were baked in a pan or grilled over the fire. It was not until<br /> the end of the Viking period that ovens were
           widely used in the household.<br /> These breads are good with all Viking foods and just as delicious on their own.<br />
           You can top them with whatever you’d like<br /> – cheese, cured meats, or even honey, butter, or Skyr.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups of rye flour</li>
            <li>1 cup of water</li>
            <li>salt (a pinch)</li>
            <li>butter for cooking (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the rye flour and salt in a large bowl.<br /> Gradually add water, mixing until you form a firm, not sticky,
                dough.<br /> You may need slightly less or more water, depending on your flour.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into small balls about the size of a golf ball.<br /> On a well-floured surface, roll out each ball as 
                thin as possible.</li>
            <li>Heat a dry skillet over medium-high heat.<br /> You can lightly butter the skillet, but traditionally,<br /> 
                this bread was baked without fat.</li>
            <li>Cook each flatbread for about 2-3 minutes on each side or<br /> until they are golden and have small charred spots.<br />
                They should puff up a bit while cooking. Serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
