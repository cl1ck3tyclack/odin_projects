        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The Vikings with their seafaring lifestyle, crafted a diet rooted in simplicity and nutritional value. Fish was among the
           most common foods eaten during Viking times. A plentiful resource caught along the long Scandinavian coastline, fish such
           as cod, herring, and salmon were usually dried as well as traded and brought inland. Whether freshly grilled upon open 
           flames or preserved for longer journeys, they were integral to the viking diet and reigned supreme at their tables in
           various forms - baked, grilled, smoked or dried.</p>
        <p>Smoking is a common method for preserving foods, and is especially good for fish. Many types of fish were preserved in 
           this manner. This recipe uses herring, but any fish will do. How long you will need to smoke the fish depends on the size of the fish. A small
           fish may take only ten minutes or so, while large fish can take much longer. The fish is done when the meat will flake 
           with a fork.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 whole fish (herring)</li>
            <li>2 turnips</li>
            <li>2 carrots</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>salt (to taste)</li>
            <li>fresh herbs for garnish (like dill or parsley)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li>Gut and scale the fish. Leave the backbone intact with the two sides still connected to it, but remove as many of 
                the remaining bones as is possible. On a large fish, cut a series of parallel slices into the muscle to allow the 
                smoke to completely penetrate the flesh. Place the fish above the fire. Remember, how long you will need to smoke 
                the fish depends on the size of the fish. A small fish may take only ten minutes or so, while large fish can take 
                much longer. The fish is done when the meat will flake with a fork.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, peel and cut your root vegetables into chunks.</li> 
            <li>Take the fish off the fire and place it on a baking tray. Scatter the cut vegetables around the fish on the baking
                tray. Sprinkle a bit of salt over the fish and vegetables.</li>
            <li>Bake in the oven for 25-30 minutes or until the vegetables are tender. Serve hot, garnished with fresh herbs.</li>
        </ol>
