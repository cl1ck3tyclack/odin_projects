        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The Vikings with their seafaring lifestyle, crafted a diet rooted in simplicity and nutritional value.<br /> Fish was 
           among the most common foods eaten during Viking times. A plentiful resource caught<br /> along the long Scandinavian coastline, 
           fish such as cod, herring, and salmon were usually dried<br /> as well as traded and brought inland. Whether freshly grilled upon open 
           flames or preserved for<br /> longer journeys, they were integral to the Viking diet and reigned supreme at their tables<br />
           in various forms - baked, grilled, smoked or dried.</p>
        <p>Smoking is a common method for preserving foods, and is especially good for fish.<br /> Many types of fish were preserved in 
           this manner. This recipe uses herring, but any fish will do.<br /> How long you will need to smoke the fish depends on the size of the fish. A small
           fish may take<br /> only ten minutes or so, while large fish can take much longer.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 whole fish (herring)</li>
            <li>2 turnips</li>
            <li>2 carrots</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>salt (a pinch)</li>
            <li>fresh herbs for garnish (like dill or parsley)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li>Gut and scale the fish. Leave the backbone intact with the two sides still connected to it,<br /> but remove as 
                many of the remaining bones as is possible.<br /> On a large fish, cut a series of parallel slices into the muscle to allow the 
                smoke to<br /> completely penetrate the flesh.</li>
            <li>Place the fish above the fire.<br />The fish is done when the meat starts to flake with a fork.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, peel and cut your root vegetables into chunks.</li> 
            <li>Take the fish off the fire and place it on a baking tray.<br />Scatter the cut vegetables around the fish on the 
                baking tray.<br /> Sprinkle a bit of salt over the fish and vegetables.</li>
            <li>Bake in the oven until the vegetables are tender.<br /> Serve hot, garnished with fresh herbs.</li>
        </ol>
