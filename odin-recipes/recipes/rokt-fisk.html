        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The Vikings with their seafaring lifestyle, crafted a diet rooted in simplicity and nutritional value. Fish was among the
           most common foods eaten during Viking times. A plentiful resource caught along the long Scandinavian coastline, fish such
           as cod, herring, and salmon were usually dried as well as traded and brought inland. Whether freshly grilled upon open 
           flames or preserved for longer journeys, they were integral to the viking diet and reigned supreme at their tables in
           various forms - baked, grilled, smoked or dried.</p>
        <p>Smoking is a common method for preserving foods, and is especially good for fish. Many types of fish were preserved in 
           this manner. This recipe uses herring, but any fish will do. How long you will need to smoke the fish depends on the size of the fish. A small
           fish may take only ten minutes or so, while large fish can take much longer. The fish is done when the meat will flake 
           with a fork.</p>
