        <p>Cod Stock Barley Porridge</p>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Fish was among the most common foods eaten during Viking times. This largely consisted of cod, herring, and salmon caught
           along the long Scandinavian coastline. Dried fish was likely a frequent ingredient in Viking-age cooking because it could
           be stored for long periods without spoiling. Grains could also be kept for months, and easily transported, which means 
           they were also a likely staple of a traveling Viking's diet. They were used to make bread, porridge, and beer.</p>
         <p>This dish combines stock from dried fish (cod), with shallots, barley, dill seeds and malt vinegar. As a finished meal, 
            this version of porridge looks more like a risotto than the oat porridge that adorns modern breakfast tables. Upon taste,
            it ticks all the boxes important for Viking age meals: it's surprisingly packed with flavour, filling and warm, perfect
            on a frigid day.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>For the stock:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 dried cod head</li>
            <li>2-3 litres of water</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For the porridge:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1¾ cups of barley</li>
            <li>5 tbsp salted butter</li>
            <li>4-5 shallots, finely chopped</li>
            <li>½ - 1 tsp dill seeds</li>
            <li>1 tbsp malt vinegar</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the stock, crush the cod head on a hard surface. Breaking it into pieces ensures you will maximize the flavor
                it gives the stock. To make the stock, put the crushed cod head into a pot with the water and bring it to the boil. Let 
                it simmer at a low temperature for 90 minutes, or until it is reduced to about half the amount of liquid. Drain and 
                discard the solids, then keep the stock warm.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, crush or grind the barley.</li>
            <li>Melt the butter in a medium or large pot, then add the shallots and sweat them over medium heat until they become 
                translucent (not browned). Add the dill seeds to the butter and shallot mixture, stirring once or twice and reduce 
                to low to medium heat. Add the barley and mix thoroughly. Pour in the malt vinegar and stir. The grains should 
                absorb the vinegar. Add more if you prefer your dish on the more acidic side.</li>
            <li>Once the stock is ready, pour in enough to cover the grains. Stir and add more, little by little. Let the pot 
                simmer on low to medium heat until the grains look soft and creamy.</li>
        </ol>
