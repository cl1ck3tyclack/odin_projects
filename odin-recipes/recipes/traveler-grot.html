        <p>Cod Stock Barley Porridge</p>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Fish was among the most common foods eaten during Viking times.<br />This largely consisted of cod, herring, and salmon
           caught along the long Scandinavian coastline.<br /> Dried fish was likely a frequent ingredient in Viking-age cooking because it could
           be stored for<br /> long periods without spoiling. Grains could also be kept for months, and easily transported,<br /> 
           which means they were also a likely staple of a traveling Viking's diet.<br /> They were used to make bread, porridge,
           and beer.</p>
         <p>This dish combines stock from dried fish (cod), with shallots, barley, dill seeds and malt vinegar.<br /> As a finished
            meal, this version of porridge looks more like a risotto than the oat porridge that adorns<br /> modern breakfast tables. Upon 
            taste, it ticks all the boxes important for Viking age meals:<br /> it's surprisingly packed with flavour, filling and 
            warm, perfect on a frigid day.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>For the stock:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 dried cod head</li>
            <li>2-3 litres of water</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For the porridge:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1¾ cups of barley</li>
            <li>5 tbsp salted butter</li>
            <li>4-5 shallots, finely chopped</li>
            <li>½ - 1 tsp dill seeds</li>
            <li>1 tbsp malt vinegar</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the stock, crush the cod head on a hard surface.<br /> Breaking it into pieces ensures you will maximize the
                flavor it gives the stock.<br /> To make the stock, put the crushed cod head into a pot with the water and bring it to the boil.
                <br /> Let it simmer at a low temperature for 90 minutes, or until the water is reduced to about half.
                <br /> Drain and discard the solids, then keep the stock warm.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, crush or grind the barley.</li>
            <li>Melt the butter in a medium or large pot, then add the shallots and sweat them over medium heat<br /> until they become 
                translucent (not browned). Add the dill seeds to the butter and shallot mixture,<br /> stirring once or twice and reduce 
                to low to medium heat. Add the barley and mix thoroughly.<br /> Pour in the malt vinegar and stir. The grains should 
                absorb the vinegar. Add more if you prefer<br /> your dish on the more acidic side.</li>
            <li>Once the stock is ready, pour in enough to cover the grains. Stir and add more, little by little.<br /> Let the pot 
                simmer on low to medium heat until the grains look soft and creamy. Serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
